*) I have provided four test data files to prove that the robot is behaving as expected.
*) To run this program, you can execute ToyRobotSimulator class and you can change the test file names in the same file to test the robot with different inputs.
*) Invalid data inputs are validated and appropriate messages are shown to the user.
*) Inputs that cause the robot to fall over are ignored.
