	* ReportBack - A project developed by Chamara S, Rajtha D & Dilan D as part of a Hackathon initiative conducted by Virtusa PVT LTD in 2012. The initial idea for the project was from Chamara.
This application enables the user to record an audio clip while taking pictures and afterwards allows the user to email that captured data as a zip file to a predefined mail address. This is mainly aimed for reporters on the move who dont have good mobile connectivity to send their repors back to base.
